This was the result of the study that I did about UniswapV2 both core and periphery.
I first looked at the whitepaper and then figured out about how does the protocol work under the hood.
After that I build it from scratch doing the tests to see what I missed to code and looking at the UniswapV2 codebase.
Protocol fees, all functions with permit, flash swaps, and trades with ETH directly are not included since are extra functionalities that are built on top of the protocol and were out of my scope.

Next goal: UniswapV3
